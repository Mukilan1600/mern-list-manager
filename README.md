# List Manager

A simple authenticated list manager built using MongoDB, Express, React js and Node js (MERN Stack).

### Important

Add the MongoDB URL and the JWT SECRET to the config file
You do not have to build your react client, Heroku post build scripts takes care of it.

### Installing

To install the dependencies run

```
# Install Server dependencies
npm install

# Install Client dependencies
npm install --prefix client
```

### Running the server

To start the server in development mode run

```
# Run both Server and Client
npm run dev

# Run Client (Port: 3000)
npm run client

# Run Server (Port: 5000)
npm run server
```
